1.⁠ ⁠National Mission on Edible Oils - Oilseeds (NMEO-Oilseeds)
Newly approved for 2024-25 to 2030-31.

Basic Details: This mission focuses on increasing the production of key oilseeds like Rapeseed-Mustard, Groundnut, Soybean, Sunflower, and Sesamum. It operates through "Value Chain Clusters" managed by FPOs or Cooperatives.

Benefits to Farmer:

Free Quality Seeds: Access to high-yielding and climate-resilient seed varieties at no cost.

Guaranteed Market: Direct linkage with value chain partners (processors) ensures you have a buyer for your produce.

Training: Free training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and weather/pest management.

Soil Health Support: Mandatory soil testing and fertilizer recommendations.

Use Case: Best for farmers in designated "Oilseed Clusters" who want to switch from low-yield crops to high-value oilseeds or utilize rice-fallow lands.

Eligibility:

Must be a registered farmer within a Value Chain Cluster.

Must be a member of the FPO, Cooperative, or group managing that cluster (typically requires ~200 farmers per cluster).


1. KALIA (Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation)Basic Details: Odisha’s flagship direct benefit transfer scheme.Benefits:Financial Support: Small & Marginal farmers get ₹10,000/year (Converged with PM-KISAN; typically ₹6,000 from Centre + ₹4,000 from State).Interest-Free Loan: Crop loans up to ₹50,000 at 0% interest.Life Insurance: ₹2 Lakh life insurance and ₹2 Lakh accident cover at nominal/free premiums.Use Case: The interest-free loan is excellent for purchasing higher-cost inputs required for oil palm or hybrid oilseeds without falling into debt.Eligibility: Small/Marginal farmers, sharecroppers, and landless agricultural households.
2. Mukhyamantri Krushi Udyog Yojana (MKUY)Basic Details: Promotes setting up "Agri-Enterprises" and commercial farming units.Benefits:Capital Investment Subsidy (CIS): Subsidy of 40-50% on the fixed capital cost (excluding land).Limit: Maximum subsidy up to ₹50 Lakh (up to ₹1 Crore for women/SC/ST/FPOs).Use Case: If you or a group of farmers want to set up a Mini Oil Mill, Groundnut Decorticator unit, or a seed processing plant.Eligibility: Individual farmers, SHGs, FPOs. Must have land and ability to invest the remaining portion (bank loan).
3. Odisha Farm Mechanization (DBT)Basic Details: Subsidies on purchasing farm machinery through the "Agrisnet" or "Odisha Farm Machinery" portal.Benefits: Huge subsidies (often 50-75%) on implements like Rotavators, Seed Drills, and Multi-crop Threshers.Use Case: Oilseeds require fine seedbeds. Using a subsidized rotavator or seed drill ensures better germination and lower labor costs.Eligibility: Any farmer registered on the Go-Sugam or Agrisnet portal.
4. Rice Fallow Management (Targeting Rice Fallow Areas - TRFA)Basic Details: A specific intervention to grow pulses and oilseeds (Mustard/Sesame) in land left fallow after rice harvest.Benefits: Distribution of free/subsidized seeds (minikits) and demonstration of technology.Use Case: Perfect for farmers in coastal/irrigated Odisha who usually leave land empty after Kharif paddy.Eligibility: Farmers in identified districts with rice-fallow potential.Summary of Actionable ConvergenceFor an oilseed farmer in Odisha, the ideal "stack" of benefits would be:Income: ₹10,000/year (PM-KISAN + KALIA).Protection: PMFBY Insurance for the crop + KALIA Insurance for the family.Cultivation: Join an NMEO Cluster to get free seeds/training + use KALIA 0% loan for other inputs.Expansion: Use MKUY subsidy to set up a small oil processing unit.

PM-KISAN

Basic Details & Benefits: Provides a direct cash transfer of ₹6,000 per year to farmers, distributed in three equal installments. The goal is to provide income support for agricultural input costs.

Use Case for Oilseed Farmers: You can use this cash specifically to purchase fertilizers or pay for labor during the critical sowing season for oilseeds.

Eligibility: All landholding farmer families (defined as husband, wife, and minor children) who possess cultivable land.

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)

Basic Details & Benefits: Offers crop insurance coverage against natural calamities such as drought, floods, and pests. Farmers pay a very low premium: 1.5% for Rabi crops and 2% for Kharif crops of the sum insured.

Use Case for Oilseed Farmers: This is critical for oilseed crops like Groundnut and Mustard, which are highly sensitive to weather fluctuations and pest attacks.

Eligibility: Open to all farmers. Loanee farmers (those with KCC loans) are automatically enrolled, while non-loanee farmers can voluntarily opt-in.

Soil Health Card Scheme

Basic Details & Benefits: Provides a detailed "report card" on the nutrient status of your farm's soil. The goal is to reduce fertilizer costs by recommending exactly which nutrients are needed, rather than generic application.


Use Case for Oilseed Farmers: This is often mandatory for farmers in NMEO clusters to ensure money is not wasted on unnecessary Urea or DAP, optimizing the specific nutrition oilseeds need.

Eligibility: Available to all farmers. Soil samples are typically collected by the state agriculture department.

Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)

Basic Details & Benefits: Provides an interest subvention of 3% on loans up to ₹2 Crore. The goal is to fund the creation of post-harvest management infrastructure.

Use Case for Oilseed Farmers: This can be used to build a small on-farm oil extraction unit or a storage shed (godown) to hold your oilseeds until market prices rise.

Eligibility: Farmers, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), and Agri-entrepreneurs.
